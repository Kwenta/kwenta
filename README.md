## Development

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then, open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTIS_APP_ID` - Portis app id (get it from [portis.io](https://www.portis.io/))
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BN_ONBOARD_API_KEY` - Blocknative Onboard API key (get it from [blocknative.com](https://blocknative.com/))
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` - Infura project id (get it from [infura.io](https://infura.io/))

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### End-2-End testing
In order to run fully automated end-2-end (e2e) tests Kwenta uses [Synpress](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress) (a wrapper around [Cynpress](https://www.cypress.io/)).  

#### Constraints 
The current e2e tests are written to be run on Optimistic Kovan using Chrome as the browser.

#### Setup
- Download and install Google Chrome 
- Setup a testing wallet on Optimistic Kovan and fund it with plenty of ETH (to pay for gas) and sUSD 
- Copy the private key of the wallet into the file `SYNPRESS_PRIVATEKEY` into the folder `kwenta/kwenta/tests/e2e`
- Before proceeding to the next step you need to setup environment variables. Navigate to the folder `kwenta/kwenta/tests/e2e` and run the following command `source ./RUN-WITH-SOURCE-synpress-env-KovanOE.sh`

#### Run the tests

```bash
npm run build
npm start
npm run test:e2e:only:tests
```
