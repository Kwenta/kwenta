## Checklist

This list tracks

- [ ] Create primary, secondary and tertiary colors for both body text and headings. Make sure that designs conform to them and add them to the theme file.
- [ ] Create component that takes in a wei value and returns the number with either a red, green or neutral color, depending on whether the value is positive, negative, zero or overridden.
- [ ] Make the `InfoBox` (and similar components) more composable, rather than prop-driven, to ensure that render performance does not suffer.
